# My Opinion on jQuantStats

## üìä Overview

jQuantStats is a Python library for portfolio analytics aimed at quants and portfolio managers. It's a modernized fork
of QuantStats, focusing on providing a clean API with enhanced visualization capabilities using Plotly instead of
Matplotlib.

## üí™ Strengths

### Code Quality

- **Clean, Well-Structured Code**: The codebase follows a clear, consistent style with excellent organization.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every class, method, and function has detailed docstrings explaining purpose,
  parameters, and return values.
- **Type Hints**: The code uses type hints throughout, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Immutable Data Structures**: The use of frozen dataclasses for core data structures prevents accidental modifications.
- **Error Handling**: The code includes proper validation and error handling with descriptive error messages.

### Architecture

- **Well-Defined API**: The API is clean and intuitive with a single entry point (`build_data`).
- **Separation of Concerns**: The code separates data handling, statistics, plotting, and reporting into distinct modules.
- **Extensibility**: The architecture makes it easy to add new metrics or visualization types.
- **Compatibility**: While moving away from pandas dependency, it still provides pandas conversion methods for compatibility.

### Testing

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: The tests cover all methods and properties, including edge cases.
- **Well-Documented Tests**: Each test has clear docstrings explaining what's being tested and verified.
- **Test Fixtures**: The use of fixtures reduces code duplication in tests.
- **Edge Case Testing**: Tests explicitly verify behavior with edge cases and error conditions.

### Modern Practices

- **Modern Build System**: Uses hatchling and pyproject.toml for packaging.
- **Code Quality Tools**: Integrates ruff for linting, bandit for security, and deptry for dependency checking.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Ensures code quality before commits.

## üîç Areas for Improvement

### Documentation

- Some TODO comments in the code (like "Please add authors...") suggest incomplete documentation.

### Feature Completeness

- By the README's own admission, some statistical metrics from the original QuantStats have been
removed with the intention to bring them back later.

### Maturity

- The version number (0.0.0) indicates this is still in very early development.

## üèÅ Conclusion

jQuantStats is a well-designed, modern Python library that shows excellent
software engineering practices. The code is clean, well-tested, and follows
a clear architecture. While it's still in early development and missing some
features from the original QuantStats, the foundation is solid and the
project shows great promise.

The transition from pandas to polars and from matplotlib to plotly represents
a forward-thinking approach, embracing more modern and performant libraries.
The clean API design with a single entry point makes the library intuitive to use.

Overall, I'm impressed with the quality of the codebase and the thoughtful
design decisions. With continued development to add back the missing
metrics and further polish the documentation, jQuantStats could become
a go-to library for portfolio analytics in Python.
